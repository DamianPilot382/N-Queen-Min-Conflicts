# N-Queen-Min-Conflicts

N-Queen Project 3 for CS 4200
Written by Damian Ugalde

To run the GUI, simply run the main method located in `Main.java`.

To compile this program, execute the following command:

`javac Main.java && javac Controller.java && java Main`

This command will compile the `Main` class and all the classes it uses.
The `Controller` class must be compiled separately, as it is called from the FXML file, not a java class.
The last command will run the `Main` method in the `Main` class.

If all fails, navigate to the `Compiled Files` directory and execute:

`java Main`
